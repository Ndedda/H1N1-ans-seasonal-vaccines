BUSINESS OVERWIEW
Vaccines provide immunizationfor individuals and enough immunization in a community can further reduce the spread of diseases through 'herd immunity.' In ths project we revisit the public response to previous respiratory diseases i.e the H1N1 influenza virus which had over 150,000 deaths in 2009-2010.

This phone survey asked respondents whether they had received the H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines, in conjunction with questions about themselves. These additional questions covered their social, economic, and demographic background, opinions on risks of illness and vaccine effectiveness, and behaviors towards mitigating transmission. 

A better understanding of how these characteristics are associated with personal vaccination patterns can provide guidance for future public health efforts through predictive classification modellinG
PROBLEM STATEMENT
The government through the National Health Insuarance Fund, prepared a survey to predict wheather people got the H1N1 and seasonal vaccines using information they shared about their backgrounds, opinions and health behaviours. 

We use the data from National Centre of Health Statistics in th United States

The National Health Insuarance Fund would like to usthis information incase of another outbreak to know how to sensitize people more on vaccine practices to be able to enhance the herd immunity and ensuring people live a healthy lifestyle.
